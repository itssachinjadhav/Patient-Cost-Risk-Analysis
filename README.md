# 🏥 Patient Encounter Cost and Risk Analysis in Healthcare Systems

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying patients with frequent high-cost encounters, analyzing procedure costs, and evaluating financial risks due to payer coverage gaps. Leveraging SQL-based analysis and Power BI visualizations, the project aims to uncover insights to improve operational efficiency, patient care, and resource planning in healthcare organizations.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Healthcare organizations face challenges in managing financial risks and costs due to:

1. Frequent High-Cost Encounters
2. Uncovered Costs by Payer Coverage
3. Trends in Procedure Costs and Diagnosis Correlations

The analysis uses SQL to identify patterns across 5 key tables:

* Encounters
* Patients
* Procedures
* Payers
* Organizations

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

* SQL: Data cleaning, querying, and analysis.
* Power BI: Interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

* Encounters: Details of patient visits, cost, class, and duration.
* Patients: Demographic details of patients.
* Procedures: Information on procedures performed during encounters.
* Payers: Payer contributions and coverage gaps.
* Organizations: Geographical and organizational-level data.

## 📈 Steps of Analysis

### 1.1 Evaluating Financial Risk by Encounter Outcome
